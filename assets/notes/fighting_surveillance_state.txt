Arsenic trioxide -> waste product for cheap
                 -> used to kill mice and cockroaches

                 Arsenic -> color pigment in green
                         -> pesticide by farmer, vibrant green color

People being posisoned by arsenic in playing cards, famous art, fabris, wallpaper
shadows from the walls of death -- in your face presentation of the problem

quick way to make money, inheritence powder, digital privacy and lack thereof

Metadata retention, dodgy apps, issues with government and privacy

disapropionately affect people such as arsenic

very cool analogy between data dumps / arsenic

most people are stil "meh" about this issue
resigned to the fact that horrible things are happening and they cant seem to do anything about it

Peak Indifference -- most people give the least of a damn


awareness of problems
reistance to the problems

- reading skill, general scientific research increased
- concepts of germs, disease, checmicasl glutens becamr understood

People were now a bit less casual about poisoning each other

Accessible Alternatives for everybody
unrealistic to expect that suddenly everyone would develop scientific understanding
maybe this would work with data and privacy ?

Privacy -- firefox builds ad-browsers into browsers now
        -- Apple markets privacy
        -- calling out companies, pressure them into changing
        -- password managers

        -- why does it still feels like nothing changed ? 

TIME , arsenic took time to set in, privacy is different

time is the key ingredient, we have to keep going with it and not giving up

fact-check corporate privacy spin, invests money into saying its doing the right thing
hold them accountable

average person in 19th century isnt a chemist
average person in 21st century isnt a hacker
- people will still think we're paranoid
- we can make a change just like back them
- we can understand the damage and suffering caused by invasive surveillance
