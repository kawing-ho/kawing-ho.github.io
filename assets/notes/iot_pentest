The cloud
consumer facing app - cloud
now government and businesses - cloud

when youre assessing

flaws.cloud
flaws2.cloud  <-- check it out

Two major trends

Lambda / Severless, no more stack , just code running in the cloud

smart heater failed so people were freezing -- @internetofshit

IoT is making its ways into enterprise

--------
Hardware
--------

presents whole new world for pentesters, new attack surface, physical skills

using hardware techniques to dump firmware -> get source -> find Web Interface RCE vulns
so it is handy !!!

achievable with budget and time constraints



Personal Safety Device:


Analyse the hardware
- understand the attack surface
- look at the functionality
- wifi, hook to access point and view traffic
- USB, USB-oriented attacks
- can get info from internet, manual, data sheets


- 3G GSM , GPS, MicorUSB, Accelerometer

Try simple things first before going deep
- telnet with default credentials

Open up the device
Tamper switches

Identify chips, debug ports, and read the data sheets

Data and Firmware


Extracting firmware and Data
- download off internet
- social engineer and get it / email developers/production
- remove SD card
- desolder the chip  (wtf)

Rework Station. hot iron and gluegun

you need to read the chip, use universal programmer to have individual chip seperated on the board, find adapter, plug into computer, auto-detect chip. download flashed contents

8MB flash chip, 8MB binary file sitting on laptop

how2analyse ??? encryption ??



firmware only connected through 3G, no endpoints, no sensitive data

Intercept comms between device and cloud

Bus snooping on the device
ILLEGAL, SDR radio analysis of proprietary protocols

Eitus Research, hackRF cutter, test sim cards

------------
3G IMSI Catching     
------------


Create a 3G network
- setup test 3G network using SDR and BTS software, USRP with OpenBTS
- depends on approval and country
- use SIm card programmed for test network
- ???
- lol failed.

Bus Snooping -- wireshark for electrical signals
Logic Analyser - saleae

soldering the wires onto the chip
serial pins that might communicate with baseband processor
hooked p to saleae and that to the laptop, decode signals accross the wire


AT+CFGRI=1\r\n <-- protocol to connect to modem, ATTENTION ! DO THIS
processor telling the baseband 

AT+CIPSTATUS (are you connecting to internet)
 ok you have connection, can you connect to custom_apn
baseband: done !

  can you start TCP connection to this hidden server on port 50138

  ok I will send data and communicate with the backend

still needed to understand communications

IMEI number, unique identifier of the device

the protocol was  !1, + IMEI + ;\x1a

no factor of authentication, here's me, great come in and send SOS alerts, whatever you wanna do

server told you if that IMEi number existed or not
can spoof location data and SOS messages

use Python script and interact with backend server !

How bad could it be?

an attacker could spoof location data of every users, send SOS , undermine company ...

you could actually spoof location, in emergency, you could kill someone indirectly

=======================================================================================
ECG Test Solution 
=======================================================================================


the hardware -- nothing interesting
the app --  nothing interesting
the website -- SQLi !!!

affected every user on the platform, can extract users medical data, modify or delete
"this is a new system it shouldnt have this vuln?"

if someone is testing themselves and they upload their results, their person may never receive medical attention if an attacker modifies the results before dotctor sees it

its about the whole solution, even when you test the boring parts that matter in the end


Why does this matter ? -- security of IoT solutions can impact lives
IoT will be targets moving forwards

========================
Full Stack Pentesters
========================
being able to go from chip through to mobile apo through to communications through to backend communications will be very important


Australia is lacking in hardware hacking, maybe take on interest in hardware hacking ?


Intro to hardware hacking !
watch youtube videos and learn to do these techniques
