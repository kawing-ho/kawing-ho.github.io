## Tamper Evidence and Locksport

I remember last year i totally skipped this section, so I dedicated some hours to this event and wasn't disappointed. 

<br/>
I learnt how to bypass simple <u>tamper-evident stickers</u> using alcohol-based substances such as **shellite**. The theory here is that most substances have a solvent, and when you apply the solvent (using a syringe for precision) the sticker will give way, and you can reapply it afterwards

|Similarly the <u>barbed plastic thing</u> _(red in picture)_ can be bypassed by simply cutting a straw, folding it into a V-shape, putting it in the hole and sliding the shim and the plastic backwards.|![sneak](/assets/images/bsides19-sneak100.jpg) |

<br/>  
The <u>wristbands</u> operate in a similar fashion to the stickers but with the added difficulty of being ribbed and also only being able to use one hand (if performing on yourself) :punch:

<br/>
While we were playing around, a physical security enthusiast from RMIT came by and gave more in-depth knowledge on the techniques as well as attempting to bypass some of the harder sutff himself. I believe he recommended us to go to `OzSecCon`, which unfortunately is in Melbourne, not Sydney

<br/>

## Talks, talks, talks

I listened to mostly talks this time around, this was a controversial subject but I actually preferred single-stream talks compared to the previous years' multi-stream in different rooms. This meant that I wouldn't have to choose between two good talks happening at the same time :twisted_rightwards_arrows:  


<br/>

## I actually went sightseeing this time !
On the Sunday morning myself, <u>@adamyi</u>, <u>@jk</u>, and Lew woke up early and went to check out the Parliament House building. :sunrise:

We took our time getting there _(by foot)_, unfortunately we had to rush through the building to take photos and hurriedly Uber back as time was running out and we didn't want to miss the Bsides bus back!

<br/>

## Stuff I didn't do
Conversely to last year, I did not take part in any of the competitions, ie: IR challenge, CTF and drone hacking.

I did network a little bit more at the event this year, but not as much as I had set out to --- imposter syndrome can be a dick sometimes...
