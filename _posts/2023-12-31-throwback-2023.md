# Memorable Client Findings
- Helped a sizable software company with their AWS Cloud & AWS Directory Service Purple Team, interesting experience overall! Although I am by no means a specialist in cloud pentesting  
  
- Helped deliver 3 tabletop exercises across the span of 2 months, one was heavily technical and another was OT/DR focused  
  
- External Perimeter Testing of a large global financial instutution, basically a large bug bounty scope of 1024 root domains
  - Found lots of cool thngs like exposed Springboot Actuators, Git repos with cloud keys and passwords ...  
  - Also took down their asia presence for a few hours...  
- Trialled `evilgophish` with a returning client for phishing campaigns and they loved the results :fishing_pole_and_fish:  
  
- Was given flights and accomodation to do a solo on-site internal pentest in Melbourne :airplane::tram:

# Work Changes

Started working from the Melbourne office in May and getting to know the team (and cold weather) :grin:  

Partay On Us in full swing is one of the best things ever I think :D
