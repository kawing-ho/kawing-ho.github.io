# Background

I was given the privilege ?  task of recording COMP6[48]43 lectures alongside another Clerk.
Usually the content is repeated since I took the course last year but this time Norman actually mentioned something and I actually learned something new that is quite useful in real-world scenarios !

# Technique explained



# Why its useful


# Practicalness 


How to find one ? Google is your friend, with the right Google Dorking we can just enter `inurl:"trace.axd"` and look for sites that match

In this case we find this: http://www.frikirke.dk/trace.axd
http://www.motion-vr.net/

On the top left they tell you how many is remaining, and there is a button open to public !!!! 
That will let you clear traces, do you know how convenient that is ????


Obviously I dont have to tell you the reader to be ethical and to do this research at your own disgression
