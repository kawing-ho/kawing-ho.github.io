#### Hello world!

It seems I have neglected my blog for a better part of two years! The time has past like a blink of an eye, it is crazy :relieved:  
  
  
Honestly, I blame a combination of covid and laziness...  
  
  
I've now backfilled several posts to commemorate any cool things/stuff that I've done/experienced between now and 2022, enjoy!  :gift_heart:

###### also, Jekyll is a bitch to use if you forget how the tech stack works :D ######

#### 2025 Update

I had to burn down my blogging environment from scratch again :fire: , and this seems to be the fastest way to get back up so far. This uses `rvm`:  

```shell
sudo apt-purge ruby rubygems # native installation was fucking everything up
rvm install 3.4.5 # whatever version tickles your fancy
rvm cleanup # reclaim space
rvm list # check using correct version, swtich if needed

# check bins and paths, make sure the rvm/ruby/<ver>/ path is present
which ruby
which gem
which bundle 
which bundler
env | grep PATH
env | grep GEM

# delete your local Gemlock file
rm Gemfile.lock

bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload # this will likely complain about missing gems
bundle install # this will install a buunch of gems but it shouldn't cause any conflicts
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload   # profit!
