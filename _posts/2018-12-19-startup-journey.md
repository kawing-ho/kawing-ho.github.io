So yeah I worked as a casual intern over summer at this lovely place called **STEMN**.


What did I learn there ? tons of things:
- Securing Kubernetes
- Had a chance to apply what I learnt in COMP6443 by doing a week-long pentest of the STEMN wep application at dev.semn.com
        -  
        -
        -
- Learnt more about Node.js
- Hands on with IAC technologies such as Packer, vagrant, Terraform -> generate pre-baked images
- I liked terraform so much I made my own project to maximize my Digital Ocean credits

- Kubernetes -> hardening and attack
- it seems quite complicated, this whole notion of pods/ nodes/ contexts
- quite cool how a kubectl given a context file and communicate with a local cluster or a secured cluster in the open
- certificates and RBAC

- yarn shim task runner
- 


sepnt two weeks reversing -> and compiling yarn
Jaeger tracing + yarn

Wrote a task-runner to replace yarn as it was too slow

- did some quick fixes to improve workflow such as pre-commit hooks (using husky) as well as hub pull requests
recently added a quick script to make splits possible (ie. select changes to commit to x branch vs y branch)



did some tweaking with Weechat... more of a time consuming thing tbh, not much expertise required :)

Created a packer image, also shared some knowledge with the founder such as asciinema
\
bash syntax such as !$ <-- used to get args of previous command, rtv (reedit terminal viewer haha)
taught about various CLI quirks too -> apropos 


The other day I hacked into his local raspberri pi and trolled him hahaha
he keeps me up-to-date with bleeding edge tech such as istio and others 

Overall really awesome learning experience, I learnt tons from this !

Right now I will be working mostly remotely and doing any tasks assigned to me. I am slowly learning the ways of Typescript (it is a superset of Javascript) and it should be fun !
