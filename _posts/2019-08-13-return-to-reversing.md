title: Return to Reversing

> My good friend and colleague <u>@SergeantSkid</u> inspired me to get back into reversing. It would also be my first time doing Windows Reversing, the challenge is that these are not your standard `ELF` files ---  
Nope, they are **`Portable Executable`/`PE`** files. So I definitely will be learning new things! :bulb:  

<br/>  

## Tools and shit

He recommended me these tools:  
- **`DnSPY`** for **C#** programs
- **`IDA`** as per usual 
- **`x64/x86 debugger`** :spider:

## Goals (upcoming/future)


I want to be able to crack my own software in the future, and not be a script kiddie who runs cracks off the Interwebz and infects himself :biohazard:  
<br/>  

#### Crackmes :hammer_and_wrench:
He showed me a website called [crackmes.one](https://crackmes.one/){:target="_blank"}, which is a community website with tons of challenges, which involve reversing witha focus on cracking techniques such as patching, keygens, etc...   
<br/>   

#### FlareOn Challenge 2019 :fire: 
I am going to participate in the _6th_ round of **The FlareOn Challenge**. Hopefully I can put those cracking skills to use!  
<br/>  


#### Moar reversing :soon: 
I was also shown another site: [reversing.kr](http://reversing.kr/){:target="_blank"}, which I might try after I finish the first two. Seems similar to [pwnable.kr](https://pwnable.kr){:target="_blank"} but that one is aimed at exploitation.

Update _Feb 20_: Another site recommended: [begin.re](https://begin.re/){:target="_blank"}
