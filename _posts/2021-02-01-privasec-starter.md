## Foreword :copyright: 
> I won't go into too much detail as some of the processes used in Privasec aren't meant to be discussed publicly :wink: :hushed:


## Offices :office:
Currently Privasec has offices in the following locations:
- **Sydney        _(main office)_**
- Melbourne
- Brisbane
- Singapore :singapore:

<br/>  

## Scheduling :calendar:
I like the way Privasec handles scheduling, in terms of:  
- scoping processes
- project time allocation and overall project management
- rest time between engagements
- research/development time allocation

<br/>  

## Reports :notebook:
- Not as automated as other pentesting firms, but gets the job done
- Processes to ensure each report is delivered to the highest quality
- New findings are added to eventually grow the cache for future use

<br/>  

## Culture :u5408: 
- Having passion for your work and also a sense of servitude to the clients is not only highly promoted, but is also <u>celebrated within the company</u>
- No "working in silos", you could talk as easily to someone in GRC or Sales as you would your fellow RED team member 
- Fun-loving: you know you don't have to take things too seriously when one of the Founders is riding his bike around the office floor for fun :bike:  
- Employees are valued more: training budgets, expense-paid trips, flexible work arrangements when you can give a valid reason

<br/>  

## My thoughts / Reflections :thought_balloon:
- More freedom means more responsibility: having the autonomy of your own time comes with the burden of learning how to manage and utilise it for the most effectiveness 
- Being upfront and avoiding the blame game: instead of dodging responsibility, problems should be resolved with mature honest discussions and proper mitigation plans to prevent further recurrence
- Learning how to raise issues early rather than shy away due to fear of repurcussions
- Learning how to ask for help, and to chase up requests, without the fear of "inconveniencing" others (within reason of course) 

<br/>  

## Misc :blossom:
- Cool shirts! If you're in Sydney and you want one, hit me up :)
