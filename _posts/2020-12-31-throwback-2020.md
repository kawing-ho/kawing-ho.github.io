# Memorable Client Findings
- got RCE on a client website through upload of an aspx webshell in their logo upload functionality :gem:  
- Broke into a fast-food kiosk with my manager :closed_lock_with_key: 
- [My 90's hacker story]({% post_url 2020-07-25-90s-hacker-story %}){:target="_blank"} of course :fire:  
- Did my first (unsuccessful) social engineering gig with my manager for a major data centre :performing_arts:

# Second Business Trip
One of my last few enagements with Pure Security was an on-site test with my manager for a critical infrastructure company in Canberra, which involved:
- **Internal Infrastructure testing of the SCADA network**

   - My manager found some creds just by dumping LSASS :)
   - The client was told to implement credential guard afterwards
- **Segmentation testing between the corporate AD and the SCADA AD network**
   - Quite cool as it involves mass nmap scans and firewall configuration reviews  

<br/>  
It was a learning experience nontheless:
- Transport was covered as my manager drove down :car:  
- The hotel was kind of meh... felt like a mashup between a dorm room and a hotel
- Breakfast was paid for <small style="font-size:0.7em;color:grey">(and thank fuck for that)</small> as it was expensive
- Got a daily allowance of $100 per working day
- Was a five day trip
- As it was nearing summer, there were 30+ degrees days :sun_with_face:

# Work Changes

I resigned from Pure Security with my last day in late December :christmas_tree:  
Then starting with Privasec early January  ~

I really enjoyed the wide variety of client work and engagements, as well as being able to have my OSCP training sponsored by the company.
