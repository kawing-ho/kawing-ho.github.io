# Memorable Client Findings
- Helped a sizable software company with their AWS Cloud & AWS Directory Service Purple Team, interesting experience overall! Although I am by no means a specialist in cloud pentesting  
  
- Helped deliver 3 tabletop exercises across the span of 2 months, one was heavily technical and another was OT/DR focused  
  
- External Perimeter Testing of a large global financial instutution, basically a large bug bounty scope of 1024 root domains
  - Found lots of cool thngs like exposed Springboot Actuators, Git repos with cloud keys and passwords ...  
  - Also took down their asia presence for a few hours...  
- Trialled `evilgophish` with a returning client for phishing campaigns and they loved the results :fishing_pole_and_fish:  
  
- Was given flights and accomodation to do a solo on-site internal pentest in Melbourne :airplane::tram:  

- Delivered 10 phishing campaigns across 8 weeks, fighting against NetCraft and friends

# Work Changes

I got promoted to Consultant (from Associate) at the end of 2022, it was a great year of upskilling for me in the internal pentest as I got exposure through:
- Two certs: CRTO and CRTP
- Fieldwork experience: Shadowed a handful of internal pentests, and led a Ransomware Readiness Assessment which I performed the internal part solo
