## Overview / TL;DR 
* As said in the description, this is **NOT** a write-up, there are many online that get straight to the point (what is required to solve the challenge) which unfortunately this gist is not :books:
* I didn't solve the challenge mainly because I got ahead of myself and missed a crucial detail in one of the many approcahes I took, in a sense I dived too deep down a rabbit hole which closed me off from the real answer, while I was digging deeper for one that simply wasn't there 
* _natas15_ is a `Blind SQL Injection` challenge, which I did not have knowledge of before *(but I do now)*, in fact the only SQLi I knew of before this was the simple auto bypass method (basically `' OR 1=1; -- `), so I'm actually glad I did this challenge til the very end because I ended up learning a lot !

## Wtf is a "Blind" SQL Injection ? 
* It's basically an SQL Injection but under the circumstances where the results aren't returned directly to you
* More often than not you will only get responses along the lines of 
  - The query didn't return anything (which means False)
  - The query returned a row / multuple rows (which means True)
  - An error in your query (which also might return nothing)
* As you can imagine it makes things a lot harder for an attacker (but not imppossible), as they can only ask the database True/False questions

___  

An example implementation in the *natas15* sourcecode:
```php
$query = "SELECT * from users where username=\"".$_REQUEST["username"]."\"";
if(array_key_exists("debug", $_GET)) {
        echo "Executing query: $query<br>";
}

$res = mysql_query($query, $link);
if($res) {
        if(mysql_num_rows($res) > 0) {
                echo "This user exists.<br>";
        } else {
                echo "This user doesn't exist.<br>";
        }
} else {
        echo "Error in query.<br>";
} 
```
> :warning: In this case the *<u>username</u>* variable is exploitable as it isn't being sanitized properly

## What I did at the beginning
##### Although this approach was incorrect it taught me a lot about the UNION and INTO OUTFILE clauses and how they can be abused

One of my first ideas was that since the results weren't returned directly to the user, I could use `UNION` to link a new select statement which would ignore the old results and dump any new results into a temporary file to be read later. The many possible issues with this approach is :
* The user currently executing the query may not have write access _(It didn't)_
* The file has to be written to somewhere accessible by the user and within the webroot directory 
* The user has to have the privileges (in this case `FILE` privileges) to even use commands like `LOAD FILE` or `INTO OUTFILE`

Example URL:
```sql
http://natas15.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?username=" AND 1=2 UNION SELECT * INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/out' FROM users ; --
```
Server-side query:
```sql
SELECT * from users where username="" AND 1=2 UNION SELECT * INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/out' FROM users ; -- "
```

**<u>Side Note</u>**: A much more dangerous version of this injection would be something like:
```sql
SELECT * from users where username="" AND 1=2 UNION SELECT '1','<?php system($_GET['cmd']) ?>' INTO OUTFILE '/whateverpath/directory/script.php'; -- 
```
which basically stores a PHP script containing a shell that you can then use to execute arbitrary commands on


I executed variations of this query mutliple times to no success, so I began to suspect that this user account had very limited privileges, unfortunately I was right

## Using the built-in functions
##### mySQL has very handy functions like user() that returns who the current user is, version() that returns the running version , etc ...
##### I also found out that SQL supports the LIKE clause, which is perfect for avoiding true equality "=" 

Starting off with a simple query like this :  
`SELECT * from users where username="" OR user() LIKE "%"`
+  **%** when used alone matches everything so when saying `user() LIKE "%"` its basically saying user() matches _ANYTHING_, which is true as long as the thing that `user()` returns is not NULL
+  **%** when used with other characters will also match up to a certain pattern such as `"%a"` matching everything that ends with `"a"` and `"a%"` matching everything starting with `"a"`
+ The **_** character functions similarly to `"."` in regex. It matches any character, so as you can see in the gif below, it can be used to guess the length of a certain field, while combined with the % character can also be used to match patterns

(After guessing the value of a certain field the `LIKE` can be replaced with `=` to ensure the correct value, since the query would evaluate to False otherwise)

* Using trial-and-error method or even a brute-force method its a slow but surefire method of leaking useful data from the database such as 
  - <u>The current user</u> (as shown above)
  - <u>What privileges this user had</u> (USAGE = no privileges besides logging in and SELECT'ing)
    ![Usage](/assets/images/natas15-3.gif)
  - <u>The version of mySQL running</u>

     URL: 
     ```sql
     http://natas15.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?username=" OR @@version LIKE "5.5.55-0%2Bdeb8u1& debug (%2B = +)
     ```
     Query: 
     ```sql
     SELECT * from users where username="" OR @@version LIKE "5.5.55-0+deb8u1"
     ```
     
  - <u>The dummy user accounts being used</u>

## I was stupid 

This is where I screwed up, I had already acquired a method to leak usernames and passwords from the *__users__* table, but somehow it never occured to me to look for a user called *__natas16__*, instead my smart-ass brain kept pestering me to find a way to execute arbitrary commands so I could cat the password file:`/etc/natas_webpass/natas16` :confused:

Although I did most of this brute-forcing stuff by hand (since it was fairly short) a proper script is recommended for brute-forcing the password since it is 32 characters long and there are `26 lowercase letters + 26 uppercase + 10 digits = 62` possible characters for each of the 32 character slots, which is `62 ^ 32` possible combinations
