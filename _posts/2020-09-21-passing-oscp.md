# Background

- I was severely ahead of most people as I graduated with a Security Degree
- Furthermore I had already worked as a pentester for 1 year at this point... 

---

# Lab Time + Methodology

- I had the lucky opportunity to be sponsored <u>90 days + 60 days</u> lab time

- Seems like a lot!   

- But I pretty much **<u>wasted</u>** 80% of the 90 days lab time by adamantly not working on it outside of work  
  
- I fully utilized the 60 days lab time in and out of work  
    _(when I wasn't on client work of course)_

- During this time I only did about **`17-20 boxes`**
  - mostly by myself
  - only consulting the student forums if I got stuck for 2 days or more...    
  - <small style="font-size:0.7em; color:gray">(Curse you Sufferance, curse you...)</small>

<br/>  

- I took notes with OneNote btw  
  
<br/>   
  
- Towards the end, I had already developed the --- 
  - methodology
  - mindset
  - <del>whatever you want to call it</del>  
    
  that allows you to:
  - identify potential entry points
  - identify and escape rabbit holes
  - ![lol](/assets/images/oscp-meme.png) _(Did I mention try harder?)_
