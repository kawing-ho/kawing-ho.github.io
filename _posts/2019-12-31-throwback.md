# First Business Trip
Out of pure luck I was selected to go overseas on-site for a Web Application test. Most tests can be done remotely but this client is particular doing it on-site so myself and a senior consultant `@DzL` went to Singapore :singapore:  

<br/>  
It was a super great experience and I can't really complain:
- All flights and hotel expenses paid, transport reimbursed
- Got a daily allowance of $125 per working day
- Was a five day trip with two days weekend (to enjoy)
- Client was kind enough to put hotel 10<small style="font-size:10px;">mins</small> walk away from site

# Friends come and go
- Unfortunately `@Tophat` has left the company to seek greener pastures.  
He will be missed :cry::tophat::coffee::computer:
- The new intern `@p1g` is joining the company after the new years break.:pig:
