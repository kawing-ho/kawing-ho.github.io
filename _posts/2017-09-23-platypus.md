|**<small style="font-size:30px">Camp? &nbsp; Conference?</small>**| **<small style="font-size:30px">Both ?!?!</small>** |
|<br/>**<u style="color:white;background:black;">&nbsp;Who went ?&nbsp;</u>**<br/><br/>--- most of the Hex Rats people <br/> --- most of the OG 9447 crew <br/> --- <u>@kathyra</u> <br/> --- <u>@papa</u> <br/>     (thanks again for tent space :tent:) <br/><br/> ![tent-city](/assets/images/platypus-tents.jpg)| ![unsw-peeps](/assets/images/platypus-peeps.jpg)|

Really appreciate <u>@idont</u> sponsoring me half of the ticket price to attend this event :raised_hands:
- Looking back <u>$100</u> wasn't really that bad of a price considering
  - The campground probably had a rental fee
  - There were prepared meals
   - Badge materials dont grow on trees
  - Transportation for the various speakers/volunteers 

<br/>

## Hardware

|Pre-assembly| Workshop time| Finished! |
|![badge1](/assets/images/platypus-badge1.jpg) | ![badge2](/assets/images/platypus-badge2.jpg) | ![badge3](/assets/images/platypus-badge3.jpg) |

This awesome badge comes with parts such as 
- microcontroller
- IR LED's
- Regular LED's
- transistor
- resistors

<br/>

#### Mini-games  
During the camp a few people would become _"Infected"_ and their badge would flash <code class="blink" style="color:red">red</code>. If they pointed their badge at yours for long eough you would then become _"Infected"_ too!
- I think its a really awesome way to break the ice
- You can go infect someone and say 'Hi' at the same time :new_moon_with_face:  

- The effect wears off after some time so you will constantly want to mingle around
  - Either to infect people
  - Or to get yourself re-infected
  - Because lets face it --- red looks cooler than green :red_circle:

There was also a flag to find if you did a packet analysis on the messages being sent over the IR channel

<br/>

## Talks // Workshops

Besides the badge workshop there was also
- **Foxhunt with SDR --- Short Distance Radio**
  - <u>@papa</u> and I hunted for RF transmissions <small style="font-size:12px">(flags)</small> around the campgrounds
  - We didn't find anything but the live exercise was fun
- 
|&nbsp;**Locksport Village**||
|_If you ever wondered what a <br/>table full of locks looks like_:| Also got to try a door bypass with a janky metal wire thingo|

## Reflections and RIP

I did fuckall for networking <del style="font-size:10px">lol</del>

**Unfortunately** --- there were no more **Platypus** events after 2017... :broken_heart:
