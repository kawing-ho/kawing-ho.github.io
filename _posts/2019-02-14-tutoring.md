### Really ?
Yeah by some stroke of luck (Valentine's day maybe?) I received news that I will be on the team of tutors for `COMP6443 - Web Application Security` for Term 1 2019. I wish I could contribute more but for now I'm stuck with tutoring a 2 hour timeslot per week in a class of 11 students. The real heavy lifters are @sy, @tjp and @carey as they build the infrastructure and challenges !. @zain is the course admin and also a casual tutor, and the other casual tutors are @hayden and @colin

### What do I teach them ?

Well I will update the list as we go but so far here is what the course content is like:
<insert table here>
Week 1 - Recon / OSINT / bruteforcing
Week 2 - SQLi
Week 3 -  Session Management
Week 4 - XSS 
Week 5 - 
<end table>

### What have I learnt so far ?
You can never truly understand a technical concept, students always ask me a question that catches me off guard, I have so much more to learn !

- I find it really refreshing to go over the content and having to warmup my muslce memory again, using tools like Burp Suite which I neglected for the previous half year, to writing SQl payloads again


- I feel like something I need to improve is my explanation skills
for example after today when I explained CSRF and CSRF tokens the students still looked confused....
        - I asked them if I was speaking too fast and they said no

- Sitting in another tutors class is also beneficial as I can see how other tutors handle the flow of their tute, how they react to certain situations and I feel that we all are learning from each other which is great :)

- Also it allows me to get closer to the lecturers norman and abhi who are professionals in the industry. They offered me a chance to guest lecture, but I still havent decided on a topic to do yet... what shall it be ?
