### Really ?
I received news that I will be on the team of tutors for Term 1 2019 of **`COMP6443 - Web Application Security`**. I would have loved to contribute more but for now I'm tutoring a 2 hr/week timeslot in a class of 11 students.  
 
The real heavy lifters are <u>@sy</u>, <u>@tjp</u> and <u>@carey</u> (and also <u>@zain</u>) as they build the infrastructure and challenges!  :wrench::triangular_flag_on_post:  

<u>@zain</u> is the course admin as well as a casual tutor   
---  the other casual tutors are <u>@blankaex</u> and <u>@bluecicada</u>.

<br/>

### What do I teach them ?

Well I will update the list as we go but so far here is what the course content is like:

| **Weeks** | **Content** |
|:------|:--------|
| 1 | Recon/OSINT/bruteforcing |
| 2 | SQLi |
| 3 | SQLi _(cont.)_/XXE |
| 4 | Session Management/CSRF |
| 5 | Access Controls (Authorization/Authentication) |
| 6 | XSS |
| 7 | SSRF/LFD/RCE |
| 8 | |
| 9 | |
| - | _(end)_ |

<br/>
<br/>
### What have I learnt so far ?

- You can never truly understand a technical concept, students always ask me a question that catches me off guard, I have so much more to learn !  
<br/>
- Humans are terrible at retaining information. At one point I wanted to explain `HMAC`'s but I totally forgot my COMP6441 material about _Confidentiality_, _Integrity_ and _Authenticity_! :disappointed:  
<br/>
- I find it really refreshing to go over the content and having to warmup my muscle memory again, using tools like **`Burp Suite`** which I neglected for the previous half year, to writing `SQLi` payloads again  
<br/>
- I feel like something I need to improve is my explanation skills
  - For example today when I explained CSRF and CSRF tokens 
  - The students looked confused afterwards...
  - I asked them if I was speaking too fast and they said no  
<br/>
- Sitting in another tutor's class is also beneficial as I can see 
  - how other tutors handle the flow of their tute
  - how they react to certain situations  
I feel that we all are learning from each other which is great :smile:  
<br/>
- Being a tutor allows me to get closer to the lecturers Norman and Abhi who are professionals in the industry
  - ```They offered me a chance to guest lecture, but I still havent decided on a topic to do yet... what shall it be ?```

<br/>
### Random stuff I did as well

- Presented my demo for 10 minutes during a lecture
  - It was a `SSRF/XSS/LFD` triple-challenge I wrote for a previous CTF
  - The prepared one wasn't functioning properly
  - It felt nice to have my five minutes of fame as a lecturer _hahaha_ 
- Filled in for <u>@zain</u> for the first 10 minutes of his class
- Worked as a **SecEDU** clerk by helping to record lectures

  
<br/>

### Updated: What I ultimately learnt from everything
- There are many ways to explain things: 
  - <u>Some analogies work and some don't</u>.
  - Usually you have to trial and error
  - Use different ones depending on the crowd you're explaining to  
    (ie. how much technical background they have)  
 <br/> 
- Some students require special care and attention
  -  especially the shy ones.    
<br/>
- Conversely, the more bold and inquisitive ones are also hard to handle
  - They occasionally <u>test the limits of your knowledge</u> by asking things that you aren't always able to answer/answer with full confidence.    
<br/>
- Sometimes you really have to drop the ball and say... **"I don't know"**, 
I'd <u>rather admit not knowing than lie</u> and provide incorrect information.
