### Really ?
I received news that I will be on the team of tutors for Term 1 2019 of **`COMP6443 - Web Application Security`**. I would have loved to contribute more but for now I'm simply tutoring a 2 hour timeslot per week in a class of 11 students.  
  
The real heavy lifters are <u>@sy</u>, <u>@tjp</u> and <u>@carey</u> as they build the infrastructure and challenges! <u>@zain</u> is the course admin and also a casual tutor, and the other casual tutors are <u>@blankaex</u> and <u>@bluecicada</u>.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
### What do I teach them ?

Well I will update the list as we go but so far here is what the course content is like:

| **Weeks** | **Content** |
|:------|:--------|
| 1 | Recon/OSINT/bruteforcing |
| 2 | SQLi |
| 3 | SQLi _(cont.)_/XXE |
| 4 | Session Management/CSRF |
| 5 | Access Controls (Authorization/Authentication) |
| 6 | XSS |

<br/>
<br/>
### What have I learnt so far ?
You can never truly understand a technical concept, students always ask me a question that catches me off guard, I have so much more to learn !

- I find it really refreshing to go over the content and having to warmup my muslce memory again, using tools like Burp Suite which I neglected for the previous half year, to writing SQl payloads again


- I feel like something I need to improve is my explanation skills
for example after today when I explained CSRF and CSRF tokens the students still looked confused....
        - I asked them if I was speaking too fast and they said no

- Sitting in another tutors class is also beneficial as I can see how other tutors handle the flow of their tute, how they react to certain situations and I feel that we all are learning from each other which is great :)

- Also it allows me to get closer to the lecturers norman and abhi who are professionals in the industry. They offered me a chance to guest lecture, but I still havent decided on a topic to do yet... what shall it be ?
