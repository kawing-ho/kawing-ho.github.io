## Environment
The HackLabs office is currently based in Manly, although they'll be moving soon. It's great for random 10 minute walks along the Corso or beach :beach_umbrella:  
![manly](/assets/images/hacklabs-manly.jpg)

Since Manly is a tourist destination, there's tons of food options nearby, definitely won't be as much variety around the new office :plate_with_cutlery::cry:  

The office uses a _"**Hotdesking**"_ concept which is pretty cool. Everyone gets a laptop and you can simply go to any desk and plug in your peripherals to work. Mouse, keyboard, headphones, external monitor included  

The staffroom has free fruit, tea/coffee and biscuits which are restocked every week, it's really great if I'm  bored/sleepy/hungry...  :apple:

<br/>

## People/Culture
So far I've met people from a variety of different backgrounds/culture --- It's pretty great as I don't feel like I don't belong in a sense. Furthermore, most of the sec people are memelords :black_joker:  

There's no need to wear full formal in office, decent clothing is enough!  
Also --- every login is done with _SSO_ and accompanied with 2Factor Auth.

<br/>

## Workload
I just  completed an external test recently and subimitted a report with the help of <u>@Tophat</u>. I also helped/shadowed other consultants in their tests and did security research in general.  (ie. playing Pentesterlab)    

<br/>

## Commute
Right now my commute consists of train + ferry, which  _realllllly_ sucks:  
- It's **1.5hr** so I have wake up super early
- It's fairly expensive (I meet the weekly/daily caps! :money_with_wings:)
- But sometimes you get nice views on the way back home

# What'd I learn/use so far?

- **`Nessus`** vulnerability scanner is awesome, although it may generate false positives/negatives sometimes  

- **`Word Report`** Template, fancy word functions like split-window editing, Document/Outline view, and Macros   
  
- **`Burp suite Pro`** license:  
   - I now have **unthrottled** Intruder!!  
     ![UNLIMITED POWER](/assets/images/unlimited_power.gif)
   - Saved projects
   - Active scanner
   - Pro plugins 
- Learning _**how2MACOS**_, took awhile to get used to the <small style="color:white; font-family:Verdana; background:black;">**&nbsp;COMMAND+Thing&nbsp;**</small> style, but iTerm2 is neat

- Network discovery tools such as:   
   - **`nmap`** <small style="font-size:12px;">(I actually had to read a book about it!)</small>
   - **`hping`**
   
- **`AWS boxes`** for phishing campaigns, grepping through password dumps, running Nessus scans from office is whitelisted for IPs and stuff

- Using a `SOCKS Proxy` to continue working if a WAF IP-bans you

- Real world stuff that CTF's dont test your knowledge on:  
   - Insufficient mail spoofing protection: `SPF`, `DKIM`, `DMARC`
   - Microsft Exchange Server Internal IP Disclosure
   - Insecure TLS Configurations
   - _and many others..._

- Be aware of bad password policies and also Account Lockout policies :sweat_smile:
