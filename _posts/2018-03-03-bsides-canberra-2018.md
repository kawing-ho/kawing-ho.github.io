> So yeah I went to Bsides Canberra with the awesome Bsides bus sponsored by SecEDU. Didn't have much time to do sight-seeing but maybe I might have time to do it again next time around!  

<br/>

### Things I did

So **Context Security** were holding this red teaming/penetration testing simulation called [**`Operation Par00t`**](https://www.bsidesau.com.au/2018/drone-ctf.html){:target="_blank"}.  

There were multiple routes to get to the final objective which was to lift up a drone! 
I invested _waaay_ too much time into this competition with my squadmates Lena, Joshua, Flora and Michael:

Although we didn't win (an industry professional who had been pentesting for 3 years managed to lift up the drone and won) we did get <u>2nd place for popping the first flag</u>. We all contributed in some way too!  
<br/> 

There were loads of neat attack vectors/entry points such as 
* `Django` webservers with **debug mode** left on
* `Wordpress` admin accounts with **default credentials**

However, most of us didn't really have that much **lateral movement** knowledge, it was definitely a good experience to know that there is much to do post-exploitation compared to the exploitation process itself!  

<br/>

In the end we won a medal and got to take a nice group photo with one of the organizers ---  <u>Gerard Kelso, from Context Security</u> ðŸ¥‡

### This I did but not so much
I also attended a few talks, some notable ones included 
- Operation Luigi  [[Blog]](https://mango.pdf.zone/operation-luigi-how-i-hacked-my-friend-without-her-noticing){:target="_blank"} [[Talk]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S3zwwCEe0E){:target="_blank"}
- Social Engineering [FOI](https://www.bsidesau.com.au/2018/speakers.html#elliott){:target="_blank"} (freedom of information)

<br/>  

There was also badge soldering which I found quite fun, it was called the [**`Busside`**](https://store.bsidescbr.com.au/products/busside){:target="_blank"} --- (my second foray into Hardware Hacking, not experienced tho)  

It has `UART` and `JTAG` inputs which allows access to debug ports on stuff like routers:
- the manufacturers may block/seal the ports but there are ways to bypass
- if memory corruption vulnerabilities are present in the firmware then it is possible to pop a shell! :shell:  


Although I have not tried this, I am quite interested one day if the oppurtunity presents itself :)   

_(in other words I'm lazy and don't really wanna fork out money for other equipments haha)_

<br/>
There was lock-picking, tamper evidence workshops as well as a CTF but I didn't take part as I was busy with the drone hacking stuff.  
 <br/>   
   
Walking around Canbera was quite fun as well, they actually have city-wide free wi-fi which is pretty neat but as my local friends warned me, it is not as lively as other cities hahaha
 <br/>   
Didn't have much time to do sight-seeing stuff but maybe **next time** I can check out the gardens/museums :bank: 

<br/>

### Things I should have done more
I wasn't really active during the after-parties as I was still shy and didn't know what to say, so I just stuck with friends and went-back earlier instead of joining in conversations.  

<br/>
_Looking back_ --- that those were precious moments that could be used to network with people from all parts of the industry, in a booming industry like this sometimes one conversation could change the entire course of your career path. I shit you not.  

<br/>
So many times I got lucky or were given opportunities just by talking to individuals or knowning a mutual friend and getting a foot in the door...  
<br/>
> Looking forward to **BsidesCBR 2019 !**
