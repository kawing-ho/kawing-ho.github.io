So yeah I went to Bsides Canberra with the awesome Bsides bus sponsored by SecEDU. Didn't have much time to do sight-seeing but maybe I might have time to do it again next time around !


### Things I did

So Context Security were holding this red teaming/penetra
Invested waaay too much time with Lena, Joshua, Flora and Michael into this thing called Operation Paroot 
which was a red teaming / real-world pen-test scenario. There were multiple routes to get to the final objective which was to lift up a drone !

Although we didn't win (an industry professional who had been pen'testing for 3 years got it to lift off and won) we did get 2nd place for popping the first flag. We all contributed in some way. There were lots of neat attack vectors/ entry points such as Django webservers with debug mode left on, Wordpress with default admin credentials and so on. However, most of us didn't really have that much lateral movement knowledge, it was definitely a good experience to know that there is much to do post-exploitation rather than just the exploitation process itself !

In the end we won a medal and got to take a nice group photo with Gerard Kelso, who was from Context Security, the organizers of this comp.

### This I did but not so much
I also attended a few talks, some notable ones included Operation Luigi as well as the Social Engineering ROI (request for information) forms social engineering.

There was also badge soldering which I found quite fun, it was called the Busside, and it helps with hardware hacking, as it as UART and JTAG inputs which can allow us to access debug ports on stuff like routers, if memory corruption vulnerabilities are present in the firmware then we can root them !
Although I have not tried this, I am quite interested one day if the oppurtunity presents itself :) in other words I'm lazy and don't really wanna fork out money for other equipments haha

There was lock-picking, tamper evidence workshops as well as a CTF but I didn't take part as I was busy with the drone hacking stuff haha.
Exploring Canbera was quite fun as well, they have city-wide free wi-fi which is pretty neat but as my local friends warned me, it is not as lively as other cities hahaha

Didn't have much time to do sight-seeing stuff but maybe next time I can check out the gardens/museums

### Things I should have done more
Looking back I was missing out on the after-parties as I was still shy and didn't know what to say, so I just stuck with friends and went-back earlier instead of joining in conversations. I didn't realise back then that those were precious moments that could be used to network with people from all parts of the industry, in a booming industry like this sometimes one conversation could change the entire course of your career path. I shit you not. So many times I got lucky or were given opportunities just by talking to individuals or knowning a mutual friend and getting a foot in the door
Looking forward to Bsides 2019 !
