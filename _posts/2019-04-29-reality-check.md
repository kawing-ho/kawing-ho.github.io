### Foreword: Before people think I'm salty

I prioritize <u>honesty</u> during interviews and I always tell my interviewer that I do not plan to obtain _`permanent residency`_  --- if that affected the decision to hire me I was totally okay with it :100:    
#### (but y tho?)

Well if you think from an organization's prespective, it doesn't make sense to train someone for 1 year or more and/or provide certs for them --- only to have them leave your company instead of growing with it right??? 

Someone told me recently that it usually takes _**3 years**_ for a new employee to become integrated into the organization, cultural and workflow-wise  

The logical step would be to enter a grad role on the work visa and follow-up with permanent residency, however I am not like others :black_joker:    
<br/>

## The Ugly Truth 
Despite having to turn me down, my interviewer today gave me solid advice, the truth hit me **hard** hence why I'm having this reflective episode now :thought_balloon:   

- **<u>It's going to be nearly impossible to find a job that gains me experience</u>**
  - Given such a short timeframe for employers to work with 
  - It is very rare for newcomers to hit the ground running
  - The company wouldn't want to invest resources into training me
  - Therefore the tasks given would mostly be basic/unstructured work
  - I do gain money, but as for career progression/experience --- forget it
    - Not to mention the pay will be minimal since theres no progression
    - I also lose time which might be better spent elsewhere 

- **<u>Self-study is great but it won't cut it for most interviews</u>**
  - Industry/Corporate businesses don't care about your self-study
  - It really boils down to what certs you have ie. OSCP, CCNP, CISSP etc... 
  - When choosing between candidates, the certified one is more favorable
  - Obviously this doesn't apply to all InfoSec jobs, depends on sector
  - Certs cost money as well :moneybag:, but definitely a good time investment! 
  - As part of career progression, certs would be paid for by company

- **<u>Perhaps I could get a meh job but use that extra money to pay for certs</u>**
  - <small style="color:lightgray;">\<insert thonk meme here\></small>
  - If I pay for my own certs, it is actually tax deductible! 
  - Company might be able to sponsor bits of the cost too
  - I would say its an average time investment 
  - I'm assuming no net gain/loss of money, but gain experience :bulb:  

- **<u>Recommended to spend around 5 years if I wanted career progression here</u>**
  - I probably won't do this though, as I want to be back home soon

#### What should I prioritise ? 

- Time? 
- Money?
- Experience?
- A combination of the above? 

All these variables make it hard for me to choose just one thing to do...
> This led me to question: **<u>What should I really be doing ?</u>**  

<br/>
## What now ? :hourglass_flowing_sand:  

There are only three outcomes really --- 
- **Go back to Malaysia early** <small style="font-size:12px;">(prematurely sounds more like it) </small>  
  - sunken-cost fallacy...  
- **Full-on commit to _5 more years_ in Sydney**  

- **Continue down this path of uncertainty and lots of forseeable rejection**  
   - no guarentee of a job that gets me experience (default)
   - _sub-path_: I use this time to earn money and pursue my own certification
   - On the bright-side this only lasts for 1.5 years more? :grimacing:

<br/>

#### Temp solution

- For now I will continue doing casual work for the uni to sustain myself
- I will also try to get into the HackLabs winter internship
- I will save up and attempt OSCP when the time comes! 

I do have plans to return to Malaysia during October but there is now a possibility that I will return for good this time...  :airplane:  

<br/>

#### Update: 25th May 2019

- After discussing with family and it seems the best outcome would be for me to <u>go for the long run</u>
- The experience I gain here will be leaps and bounds better than back home
- I can enter into senior positions straight away when I return home

No matter what discomfort I feel I will have to deal with it for the success of my future :muscle: :sparkle:

## Meta 
I think it really helps for me to lay down all the hard facts and to compare which option is the most beneficial for me, this blog post will also help me to explain my situation to others and seek advice :bamboo:
