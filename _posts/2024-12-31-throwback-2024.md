# Memorable Client Findings
- got a SSTI to RCE through FreeMarker Injection in an admin panel. I actually tested the same app two years ago but found this well-hidden vulnerability through newfound OSWE knowledge and simply looking at additional attack surface that was glossed over last time around
- Internal Penetration Test got a DA service account by spraying `P@ssw0rd` 
- Phishing early in the year managed to somehow beat Microsoft Secure-by-Default using Mimecast, and also turns out NetCraft will whitelist if you ask nicely :sparkles:
